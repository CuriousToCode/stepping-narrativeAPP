# stepping-narrativeAPP

This project is built using the Fitbit API and the git repository of orcasgit/python-fitbit -- SEE https://github.com/orcasgit/python-fitbit for more details 

Purpose:
The primary purpose of this pet project is to create a native data pipline for which behavioural insights observed using Fitbit step tracking technology to (A) pull, (B) store, and (C) email content to indivduals to increase the liklihood of successfully achieving behavioural goals (i.e. increase physical activity). 

(A) Pull = direct communicaiton with Fitbit API
(B) Store = client data is housed within DBSM - postgres sql on a local drive
(C) Email = daily emails sent containing personalized supportive texts along with 4 updated subplots describing a stepping narrative attached as a single .jpeg file. 

Stepping Narrative:
Generally speaking, people lead busy lives and while PA is important, it's not always easy to 'collect' much needed steps with a high degree of understanding for how those steps were manufactured. A stepping narrative speaks to the story of one indivudals stepping 'patterns' throughout the day - [volume x timing] (steps/minute) over the lifespan of wear-time (hrs, days, months, yrs, etc.)

Timeline:
The project has been active for approximatly 4 months. Additonal help is welcomed!
